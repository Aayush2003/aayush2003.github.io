I am Aayush Rajesh, a first-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Tsachy Weissman](https://web.stanford.edu/~tsachy/) in the [Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University](https://ee.stanford.edu/). Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor of Technology (with Honours) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2024.  

My research interests are in areas along the intersection of electrical engineering and computer science. More specifically, I am fascinated by the fields of Information and Coding Theory, Probability Theory, as well as their applications.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading books, being an avid bibliophile. I also follow and play cricket, basketball, and chess. Astronomy is a big hobby of mine, due to the irresistible allure of peering out into the vast expanses of the cosmos, to understand where we came from, and where we are headed.
